				<p>Version control is a system that saves and logs changes made to your files. With version control, you are able to revert back to a previous working edit at any time in case you do something horribly wrong. Each save-point is known as a commit. </p>
				<p>Git helps you keep track of changes by keeping a log of the commits you have made. This is done by typing "git log" in the command line interface (CLI, or Terminal in OSX). With git, you are also able to save different versions of the master copy to a branch copy; which you can name it to be whatever you want it to be. </p>
				<p>GitHub is an online destination for all your code. Here, you can share your code with developers around the world, and have them contribute to your code. You can also work on someone else's project. Using GitHub, you are able to "push" your local git files to your online profile at GitHub. Your profile is where you can view which repositories (or folders) you have.</p>
