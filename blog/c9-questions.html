				<p>We all have questions, and asking questions is a good way to increase your knowledge. Are you asking the right way though? In this day and age of internet, a lot of our communication happens through a text-based medium. This requires a different skill-set than communicating in person since you no longer have instant feedback on how your audience perceives you. This means that you need to be able to present yourself properly in order for the other person behind the screen to receive you well.</p>
				<p>Before you go asking questions, have you done enough research? Chances are that your question is not unique and there has been someone else who has asked it before. Make sure you put enough effort into finding out the answer to your question prior to posting it to a forum. It would be better to exhaust Google Sensei before asking other humans. Google Sensei has ultimate patience. Also, asking good questions is hard; it's much less time consuming to do your own research before attempting to frame your question in a worthy manner.</p>
				<p>So you've tried finding your answer but to no avail. The next step would be to construct your question. Stay away from asking general questions, since you will most likely get a general answer. Also if it's that general, it has probably been answered already. In your specific question, you want to give as much context as possible to the reader so that they have all the information required to answer your specific question. You want to include information such as: language, operating system, software, error message, and any constraints you have. If you can provide a snippet of the code you have trouble with, include it, but don't copy and paste your whole program.</p>
				<p>Once you have all the relevant information to your question you want to go do two things, think of a title, and proofread your question. Your title should be a summary of your question that is eye-catching. This is the first thing people see of your question, and thus has the most impact in whether or not people take a second look at your question. Make sure you use proper grammar, spelling, and formatting to the best of your ability. This makes your question easier to read, and increases the likelihood of you getting an answer. It's important to remember that no one has to answer your question, so if you're not going to put in the effort to ask nicely, why should they bother to answer you? Be considerate!</p>
				<p>Another way to be considerate is to actively monitor your question and respond to feedback on it. If you're not going to participate in your own question, why should others? If you like an answer to your question, it would be a good idea to thank the answer's author.</p>
				<p>To summarise, be as detailed as possible in your question, include a short title that describes your question, proofread for grammar, spelling, and format, be active in responding to feedback, and thank people for their time.</p>
