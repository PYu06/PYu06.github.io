				<p>Recursion is when you try to define something but need to use what you're defining in the definition. A popular example of this is the Fibonacci sequence which takes the the 2nd last item and sums it to the last item. There are two principles of recursion: 1, There needs to be an end goal, or a base case. 2, The process reduces the task towards the base case. </p>
				<p>In computer programming languages, you can usually choose between using a recursive or iterative algorithm. There are some trade offs to consider when using either one. Iterative algorithms have been found to have better performance computer wise, because you don't need to store the function calls in the memory stack. On the other hand, there are some algorithms that may be hard to define using iteration.</p>
				<p>The argument for recursion is that it may be easier for the programmer to understand. Thus making the code easier to read and understand for future programmers. The drawback for recursion is that depending on the workload, it may require a lot of memory, reducing the performance and increasing load time of the file. </p>
				<p>In the end, the coder has to decide whether they think it would be easier to use recursion or iteration.</p>
