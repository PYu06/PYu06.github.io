				<p>Hello! This week I'm going to be talking about the difference between a Ruby hash and a JS object. I think it'll be easier to start with the similarities. When I first saw JS objects, the first thing that came to mind was that it looks almost like a ruby hash:
<pre class="code"><code>
	Ruby:
	paul = { name: "Paul", age: 26, fav_colour: "red"}

	JavaScript:
	var paul = {name: "Paul", age: 26, favColour: "red"};
</code></pre>
				They do look pretty similar, they both have key:value pairs and you access the value by calling the key. There are quite a few syntactical differences though:
<pre class="code"><code>
	Adding new properties:
	Ruby:
	paul[:hair_colour] = "Black"

	JavaScript:
	paul.hairColour = "Black";
</code></pre>				
				Other than just listing syntax differences (which you could easily look up in the docs), something I found interesting about JavaScript objects is that you can add functions in them:
<pre class="code"><code>
	paul.info = function() { console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name + ", I like the colour "<br>           + this.favColour + ", and I am " + this.age + ".")};
	paul.info()
	=> Hello, my name is Paul, I like the colour red, and I am 26.
</code></pre>	
				That's a simple function, but I think it's pretty neat that you can add it into the JS object as a property like that. So if you call the object paul you get:
<pre class="code"><code>
	console.log(paul)
	=> { name: 'Paul', age: 26, favColour: 'red', hairColour: 'Black', info: [Function] }
</code></pre>
				 I haven't able to find out if that's possible in Ruby yet. You are able to have method calls on the Ruby hash, but it doesn't save it inside the hash. </p>
