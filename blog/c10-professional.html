				<p>So I'm supposed to make my blog look more professional. I think the main thing about it was that it looked unfinished. I changed the background colour, link interaction, and changed the font. Although I'm trying to keep a minimalistic look to my site, I think I could add more design to my header by adding a logo of some sort. That will be my next project for the site.</p>
				<p>This time around, I mainly worked on making the overall site look better. I did some research into the types of fonts that you should use, and I chose one which I think is easy to read.</p>
				<p>After a few weeks of playing around with my site, I'm also finally starting to get more comfortable with CSS. Except these last two weeks I was introduced to JavaScript and jQuery, so now I need to do more reading into those and incorporate them into my site.</p>
				<p>Since this site is to showcase my progression as a developer, I don't think it will ever be finished. It'll just be iteration after iteration. I've barely begun my journey as a coder, but tomorrow I finally set foot in DBC. Looking forward to these coming weeks!</p>
