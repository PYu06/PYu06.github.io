<!-- This template is in markdown, not html, so
  it will not render beautifully when you copy and
  paste it into your github.io site, but it will at
  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) -->

*Describe Version Control

Version control is a system that saves and logs changes made to your files. With version control, you are able to revert back to a previous working edit at any time in case you do something horribly wrong. Each save-point is known as a commit. 

*How does git help you keep track of changes?

Git helps you keep track of changes by keeping a log of the commits you have made. This is done by typing "git log" in the command line interface (CLI, or Terminal in OSX). With git, you are also able to save different versions of the master copy to a branch copy; which you can name it to be whatever you want it to be. 

*Why use GitHub to store your code?

GitHub is an online destination for all your code. Here, you can share your code with developers around the world, and have them contribute to your code. You can also work on someone else's project. Using GitHub, you are able to "push" your local git files to your online profile at GitHub. Your profile is where you can view which repositories (or folders) you have.
