				<p>According to this <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">link</a>, the compass of shame is how people deal with shame. Particularly people with a low self esteem. The labels I have been given by this all knowing compass is Withdrawal (North) and Avoidance (South). Thanks, time to go run away, deny that you're right, and drown my sorrow in a drunken stupor. Also, way to reduce my self esteem by now illuminating the fact that I exhibit these traits means I have low self esteem! Talk about self esteem recursion.</p>
				<p>Okay, in all seriousness though. I know that I tend to withdraw and avoid conflict when confronted with shame. I know this because at one point I didn't do so well in school. I knew this, and I was filled with shame. Guess what I did? Yup. I withdrew from my family, and avoided them at all costs so they wouldn't find out. Phew! Now they would never know. That worked out really well in my favour &lt;sarcasm&gt;. It was a journey down a slippery slope; I didn't seek the help I needed, and I didn't confront the problem, so I continued to do worse and worse. Clearly my actions only amplified the problem.</p>
				<p>If I had the foresight at the time to face my fear, I would have confided in my family earlier. I was really afraid to face the wrath of their anger at my negligence, but instead I was slapped with love and support. Geez, thanks family for being better than I imagined. This was definitely a learning experience for me; sometimes the biggest fears I have only live inside my own mind. It's a continuous learning process; noticing when I go into withdrawal and avoidance mode whilst facing shame, and then withdrawing and avoiding going into those states. =P</p>
