#### Kitchen or Table?
#### 09/21/14

I watched the "Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table" video, and have been brewing over what he addressed. The experience at DBC is really what you make of it. The most successful student will be the one that takes a hands-on approach to their learning. The analogy Shereef used was that of a restaurant staff vs. a patron of the restaurant. The latter comes to the restaurant, likes what the menu has to offer, but complains if there is a hair in the food. Compared to the patron, the restaurant staff would see the hair, and think of solution to avoid getting hair in the food in the future. Basically, the take home message for me is: make the most out of your time at DBC and take ownership of your own learning experience.

My impression of DBC so far is that it is filled with self-motivated learners that aren't afraid of taking risks and working hard. I like this type of environment because it inspires me to be a better student at life. I'm really excited to be a part of this program which doesn't try to just teach you about learning a programming language. DBC tries to impart values of engineering empathy; not only being self aware of your own motivations and thoughts, but to also be able to empathize with other students. 

I'm also excited to begin pair programming. I think it will be beneficial to learn from programmers better than me, and hopefully I can also become proficient enough to be able to teach others as well.
