				<p>I tend heavily towards Abstract Random thinking, but have an equal amount of Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential thinking. This means that I predominantly like perceiving abstractly and ordering randomly. I think the best way for me to learn would be to draw mind maps as notes. This allows me to "chunk" information, and to be able see connections with other links easier.</p>
				<p>The biggest struggle for me so far at DBC has been reading and retaining all the syntax for the different languages. I think the best way for me to overcome this struggle is to write down more notes and review them more often. This week I noticed that when I was solving the challenges, I learned best by pseudocoding first, looking up the proper syntax, then refactoring. I definitely learn a lot faster by trial an error rather than reading a whole bunch of theory and trying to apply it straight away.</p>
				<p>I think I've been approaching the Growth-mindset all wrong. I've been trying to prove to myself that I'm capable of achieving my goals. But what I should really be doing is focusing on stretching my mental capacity. I should be developing an increasing intelligence mindset. Not one that learns what is necessary to just get the job done, but to go beyond that and to be able to expand my knowledge base.</p>
				<p>Another thing I need to work on, is putting in more effort. I need to tell myself that failure isn't a mark of lack of intelligence. Rather it is the insufficient amount of effort put forth into an action.</p>
