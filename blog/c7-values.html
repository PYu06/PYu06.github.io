				<p>This week's cultural blog is determining which value you place the most importance on. For me, that is will-power. I find that the times I'm the happiest or most proud of is when I can control what I want to do when I want to do it. Will-power unwavering! I feel like having a strong will is conducive to getting things done; especially when you don't particularly enjoy a task, or when you're feeling lazy and unwilling to just do what needs to be done. Being able to push through the struggle and attaining your goals. I find that there are so many distractions in life, and staying focused can be trying. That's when will-power comes in and kicks you into motion or keeps you on track. I've realised that I tend to procrastinate often, so exercising my will-power is like making a promise to myself and when I fulfill that promise, it brings me joy. I like surprising myself that way. I don't like being lazy; it may give me some satisfaction, but it is short lived. Life doesn't come with a pause button, eventually tasks pile up and start to hit the fan. I've learned that the salient key to success is delayed gratification.</p>
				<p>In general, I try to be conscious of my will power. It's just a matter of practice and exercise. There are times when I struggle and become lax, so it's important to me to reduce the amount of times this happens. Time is short. You need to make the most of it.</p>
				<p>Having a strong will stops the harpies from luring you into temptation. So does having friends tie you to a pole. Some time ago, a friend asked me about relationships. How do you stay committed? I believe will plays a big role here. You need to know what it is that you want. Are you willing to work through something, or dump it all and give it up?</p>
				<p>Speaking of giving it all up. I've been scrambling to catch up with my DBC readings. There are so many books to read that when I see the daunting list, I feel overwhelmed. Luckily that's when I think about will-power. Pow! Get it done. One page at a time. This is what you have chosen to do. Enjoy the journey, even if you're stumbling through it.</p>
				<p>Last week my cultural blog was about stereotype threats. Having a strong will definitely helps overcome these odds. A strong belief in your own identity sifts the general criticism into objective criticism and illuminates areas where you can improve.</p>
