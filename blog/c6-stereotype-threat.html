				<p>Stereotype threat is when one feels a negative stereotype towards the group they belong, whether it is a racial group, gender, or even a generational group. The threat is that the individual conforms to the belief associated with their group and this affects their performance. A well known stereotype threat is in Black students doing worse than White students in standardised tests that emphasized race.</p>
				<p>Whilst growing up in Kenya, there were very few Chinese, but fortunately I never experienced any stereotype threat. However when I moved to Canada, I learnt that as a Chinese, I was supposed to be a very good student; especially in math subjects. I think that this kind of stereotype threat did not hinder me much, as I should've been striving towards being a good student anyway. Also, luckily, I enjoyed math and consequently did well in it.</p>
				<p>A common stereotype against Chinese people is being a bad at driving. This only caused me to break apart from the norm, and learn to be a good driver. Good thing I have had good role models to learn how to drive from.</p>
				<p>I've found that stereotype threat can be very harmful, but ultimately you choose what you want to believe. It is unfortunate that such a thing exists, but if anything, it should make you strive harder to be better as an individual. It's hard to change peoples' perceptions of an entire group, but it all begins with you. You can't control how people think, but you can change how you act and react. One way you can react to a stereotype threat is to reframe the context of the situation. I recently watched a performance by the comedian Trevor Noah, who is a mixed Black/White South African who faced (and probably still faces) racism. He proposed that the word 'kafir' should be embraced and have the word's meaning be changed from a negative connotation to a positive one. He basically said that from now on people should use that word as a compliment, and hopefully over time people won't be insulated to be called that.</p>
				<p> I think what people fail to realise is that at the end of the day, we're all people; the colour of our skin, our gender, or any other kind of group we relate to, shouldn't be our defining characteristic. It all begins with you though. Treat yourself how you would like others to treat you. If you face a stereotype threat, don't see it as a defining characteristic of your group and get hung up on it, instead view it objectively and singularly, then try harder to improve yourself. Don't let other people's uneducated view of an entire group affect you as an individual. Just like in OOD; let each method have a single behaviour and fix the bug!</p>
