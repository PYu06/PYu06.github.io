				<p>Hello! Cultural blog time. This week the topic is about pairing, and giving and receiving feedback. Pairing is about collaboration between two programmers to solve a problem. During this phase of DBC, we are primarily using driver/navigator roles. After our pairing sessions we have to give anonymous feedback to our partner that is Actionable, Specific and Kind. Giving feedback is important because it makes us reflect on our session.
				</p>
				<p>Pairing with other people is interesting because you get to see how other people think and solve problems, then you join that with your own knowledge and experience to find a solution. Through my pairing sessions, I've been able to learn a lot from my partners. Not only from them showing me a new method or combining methods in a certain way to produce a result, but also from me teaching them things that they are not so familiar with. I've had a lot of fun with pair programming, but I've also had some where the session is rather challenging. What I find the most frustrating is my own lack in being able to express myself through code, and when my partner has the same issue, that's when we run into problems. This leads to a slippery slope where we're both stuck trying to explain ourselves if we're lucky, or long stretches of silence where I'm uncertain of what we're doing. Consequently we take a long time to solve the challenge. I think the only way to overcome this is to put myself in a position where I can comfortably code mine, and my partner's concepts.</p>
				<p>That's where feedback kicks in. I think I've been fortunate in that all the feedback I've received has followed the ASK criteria well. My partners have been able to give me some good advice on how to improve my coding skills, and also give me some tips on how to be a better pair partner. A criticism that I've received is that I need to speak up more and let my partner know what I'm thinking. As a shy person, this is quite difficult for me, but someone reminded me that I'm a part of DBC and that this is definitely the place to be open and frank about my work, work process, questions, and struggles. Thanks for the reminder anon!</p>
				<p>I also struggle giving feedback because I'm in awe in how much my partners know that I don't know where to start to give them advice in how to improve. What's helping me give better feedback is the feedback on my feedback < insert xzhibit >! It definitely helps being told that my feedback isn't actionable enough, or that sometimes its 100% neutral on specificity. Another helpful guide in giving good feedback is rating other people's feedback. It helps me see what I like and don't like about feedback, and I incorporate that into my own feedback.</p>
				</p>Overall, I enjoy the whole process of pairing, giving, and receiving feedback. I feel that it's accelerating my learning process by being taught, and also by teaching. There's also a lot of satisfaction in collaborating and completing a project, then receiving and giving kind feedback!</p>
