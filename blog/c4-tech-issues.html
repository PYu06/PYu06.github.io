				<p>Silicon Valley! The centre of technology. Too bad it lacks diversity. According to this <a href="http://pxlnv.com/blog/tech-company-diversity-stats/">site</a>. The major tech companies are heavily populated with White or Asian ethnicities. The reason this is an issue is because with a lack of diversity, you have a lack of varied ideas. In general, people tend to find solutions for problems they face. This means that if the majority of programmers are the same race, they will focus on solving problems pertaining to them.</p>
				<p>Major tech companies have realized this deficit in ethnic diversity, and are now trying to fill quotas of hiring a minimum number of minority groups. I think this is a step in the right direction, but how come there is such lack of other ethnicities in programming?</p>
				<p>Upon further reading it appears that "culture" and fitting in has something to do with why there's a lack of diversity. This may mean that there isn't necessarily less minorities becoming programmers; another factor may be that these minorities aren't getting hired.</p>
				<p>A possible solution to having more minorities hired could be to train the hiring managers to recognize if and/or what they are being biased of towards potential hires.</p>
				<p>I also think that ethnic minorities in computer programming need more public role models to inspire others to become programmers.</p>
